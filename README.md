# Errors 

If you want to see this in action, feel free to fork and clone. You'll need to set up a connection string to a database, then run the init.sql file from the db folder. There are a few different endpoints to test in Postman and one on the frontend if you feel so inclined to check that out. In order to see the errors and possible console logs, you can comment code from the get_harry.sql file for the frontend, or the get_all_books.sql for the Postman endpoints.
